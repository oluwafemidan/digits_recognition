# MNIST Handwritten Digits Dataset

The data set contains images of hand-written digits: 10 classes where each class refers to a digit.

Preprocessing programs made available by NIST were used to extract normalized bitmaps of handwritten digits from a preprinted form. 30 contributed to this training set. 32x32 bitmaps are divided into nonoverlapping blocks of 4x4 and the number of on pixels are counted in each block. This generates an input matrix of 8x8 where each element is an integer in the range 0..16. This reduces dimensionality and gives invariance to small distortions.
## Significance of MNIST
Benchmarking Tool: MNIST serves as a foundational dataset for testing new machine learning algorithms and models. It has been extensively used in research and education due to its simplicity and accessibility.
Model Evaluation: The dataset allows researchers to evaluate their models' performance against established benchmarks, facilitating comparison across different methodologies.

## Historical Context
The MNIST dataset was created by Yann LeCun and his colleagues, who aimed to provide a standardized dataset for evaluating machine learning algorithms. It has since become a staple in the machine learning community, often serving as an introductory dataset for those learning about image classification techniques.
